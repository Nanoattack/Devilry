Devilry is a demon invocation mod inspired by the many past and present magic mods that came before it.

Devilry's content is subdivided into 3 main sections;
Demonic Pacts, Alchemy & The Infernal Descent.

Demonic Pacts :
Demons are creatures that one can summon through performing rituals. They are denizens of hell, so always keep your wits about you when conversing with one. A pact is gained once an initial request is completed for a demon. Pacts can be upgraded by completing subsequent quests, providing them with offerings, or otherwise. Upgraded pacts will result in new crafting recipe reagents, gifts or lore transcripts.

Alchemy :
The science of understanding, deconstructing and reconstructing matter. However, it is not an all-powerful art. It is impossible to create something out of nothing... or so... is assumed. While humanity itself seems to have a simple understanding of the alchemy in our world, access to demonic intervention has proven that there might be more than meets the eye. Perhaps it can be used to create powerful artefacts, reagents of unlimited potential or even... life itself? Just make sure the price isn't your very soul.

Infernal Descent :
It is not unheard of, for even a mortal being to venture the plains of hell. One such legend, describes a man named Dante and his traversing through the many layers. It would only be logical to assume, that if such a tale was true, that he would leave a journal of some sorts. The question, where would he leave itÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉ..?
